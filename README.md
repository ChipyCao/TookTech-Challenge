# TookTech-Challenge
Just a rudimentary code with no real implementation that is meant to solve the requirements of a challenge and showcase my use of OOP and general coding knowledge.
These classes and functions are only meant to show their basic function and the way they interact with eachother and with the data.
They are not meant to be a representation of the final implemented version.
