# TookTech-Challenge
Just a rudimentary code with no real implementation that is meant to solve the requirements of a challenge and showcase my use of OOP and general coding knowledge.
These classes and functions are only meant to show the basic mechanism between them and the use of the data in general. 
They are not meant to be a representation of the final implemented version.
